# The Digital Randomizer project

# Description

The Digital Randomizer project aims to develop a digital device that randomize integer
numbers using an ATmega328P microcontroller. There are 2 MCUs, one is the processing
device and the other one is the human interface one. The HMI MCU is connected to 1
7-segments, 5 LEDs, 3 push buttons, servo motor, buzzer. And the processing MCU is
connected to 3 LEDs.
